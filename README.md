### Hi there, I'm PaweÅ‚. ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for visiting me :) 

# ðŸ’« About Me:
Iâ€™m currently working on Frontend Mentor challenges. I want to create few commercial static websites and do Codewars tasks soon. <br><br>My tech stack is HTML, CSS (SASS, SCSS, BEM methodology) and Vanilla JS. Iâ€™m improving my JavaScript to be able to learn React framework.<br><br>If you checked my repos and found something I need to correct, please tell me. I want to improve as much as itâ€™s possible. Iâ€™m open for any collaboration.<br><br>I like to spend my free time training and developing strength (powerbuilding). I love to read business, economy, physics and personal growth books. <br>
